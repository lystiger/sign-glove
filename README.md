# ✋ Sign Glove AI – Real-time Gesture Recognition System

This project enables real-time sign language translation using a smart glove equipped with flex sensors and an IMU. The system collects gesture data, allows dataset management, trains machine learning models, and performs real-time prediction using a trained model.

## 📚 API Usage

- Interactive API docs: [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs)
- Redoc docs: [http://localhost:8080/redoc](http://localhost:8080/redoc)

### Example: Create a Gesture Session

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/gestures/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "abc123",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-23T12:00:00Z",
    "sensor_values": [[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.1]],
    "gesture_label": "hello",
    "device_info": {"source": "USB", "device_id": "glove-01"}
  }'
```

### Example: Get Dashboard Stats

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/dashboard/
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

From the `backend` directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx
pytest
```

- Some async DB tests may be skipped or xfail due to Motor event loop issues on Windows.

---

## 🐞 Error Handling & Trace IDs

- All error responses include a `trace_id` field.
- If you encounter an error, provide the `trace_id` to the development team for fast debugging.
